## Description

Water World is a game where all entities are molecules. 
The player must eat green molecules and avoid the red ones.

This project resembles a Deep Q Learning AI made in Python with TensorFlow 
that managed to learn how to play the game, knowing only the current score and
the state of his own vision sensors.
